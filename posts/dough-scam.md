# 2022-12-15

I ordered the 27" Spectrum OLED 2022-12-15 for 798 EUR. Back then shipping was promised a few months later if I remember correctly.

# 2023-11-03

Dough sends an email about a new PLC being developed for the monitor. 

> Since you’ve ordered Spectrum Black 27, you can of course keep your order as-is and receive it on our expected shipping date. However, since you’ve already waited so long, we don’t want you to be stuck with a product that is no longer the latest and greatest, as was Spectrum Black 27 when you ordered, so we’re offering to upgrade your order to this new improved variant shipping in May 2024 at no additional cost to you. Yep, that’s right, you’ll keep your incredible early backer price and get an upgrade. It’s the least we can do for you.

I took the offer.

# 2024-05-08

An upgrade from 240 Hz to 480 Hz is offered.

> Due to some production challenges, we are now offering a special opportunity to upgrade your current model to our latest innovation – the Spectrum Black 27" 480 Hz model, at no additional cost to you. This new version not only features the high brightness you expect but also comes with an impressive 480 Hz refresh rate, all encased in a sleek aluminum housing for enhanced durability and performance. /.../  2 - Opt for a free upgrade to the forthcoming Spectrum Black 27 480 Hz model, which features high brightness and a refresh rate of 480 Hz. This model will also be housed in aluminum, eliminating the gap issue and ensuring a superior product. **We expect to begin mass production of this model in early September**, shortly after the launch of the Spectrum Black 32 in August. /.../ If you ordered a Spectrum Black 27" or upgraded to the Higher luminance model and would like to upgrade your order to the Spectrum Black 27" 480Hz model for FREE! Respond to this email and we will apply it to your order!

# 2024-05-20

I mail them and accept the 480 Hz offer, my order is updated to reflect this.

# 2024-08-14

Markering email from Dough. "480Hz OLED is Here!". I haven't gotten my monitor though...

# 2024-09-30

September is at its end. No monitor in sight as promised this month.

# 2024-12-02 

The September deadline isn't met and I'm tired of waiting. I mail Doguh and ask then to cancel my order and refund the money.

# 2024-12-03

Kyle at Dough sends an email:
> I would first like to apologize for the delays in the process. The Spectrum Black 27 480Hz just came off the production line  and is preparing to ship out within the next two weeks. I do understand that you want to cancel due to not meeting our exact shipping timeline estimation. If you wish to continue with the cancellation, we can take care of that for you, I just need you to reply back confirming your wish to cancel. 


I reply I still want to cancel.

# 2024-12-06

Markering email from Dough, "Black 27 Is Coming"

> Production for Spectrum Black 27 is about to commence, and just like with Black 32, customers will start receiving their orders very soon! This also means that retailers will be listing the product in no time, but we won’t be able to offer our current prices any longer. Starting at just $799 in retail, it beats the pricing of even the 240Hz last-gen monitors, but you still have time to save even longer and get an order in at just $649! Don’t miss out, prices will go up to its MSRP on Tuesday!

# 2024-12-09

Kyle at Dough sends an email:

> We would like to confirm that your order has been successfully canceled. We understand that sometimes plans change, and we're here to support your decision.
> Regarding your refund, we have initiated the process. Please allow 3-5 business days for the amount to be reflected in your account.

> Thank you for choosing Dough!

He also attaches a screenshot from his system where the order is canceled.

# 2024-12-10

I get a "Your order has been canceled" email with some "Refunded" lines. I get not refund though.


# 2024-12-19

I have still not gotted the refund. I email Kyle;

> 10 days have lapsed now and the refund has not happened.

# 2024-12-20

Kyle responds:

> I am still showing that the refund has processed with no issues on our end to the card ending in 1064. There may be a delay in the process between the two banks. 

Kyle attaches a screenshot again with some transaction details revealing Stripe is the payment processor.

I contact my bank, Revolut, asking them to check into it. They say there is no pending incoming transactions to me. 

I email Kyle back;

> Can you double check with Stripe? Must be something wrong on their end. My bank, Revolut, says they can't see any refund on the way.

# 2025-01-17

No words back from Kyle or Dough. I email them;

> Get this sorted by the end of the month or I'll take the matter including interest rate to the The Swedish Enforcement Authority to collect the debt.

# 2025-01-19

Kyle:

> Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention. We understand your request for a refund and apologize for any inconvenience caused.
> Currently, I have no new information on your refund as it has been initiated but has not been successfully processed. I will reach out to finance to ensure this get resolved for you as soon as possible!
> If you have any further questions or need assistance with anything else, please don't hesitate to let us know. We're here to help and ensure your satisfaction as much as possible.

# 2025-02-08

I ask;

> Any update?

# 2025-02-12

Kyle:

> Thank you for contacting us! We appreciate your patience and are here to help with any questions or requests.
> We understand the importance of your refund request and sincerely appreciate your patience. Our team is currently reviewing your case, and we are working diligently to process requests as efficiently as possible.
