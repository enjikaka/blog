I'm a web developer from VÃ¤rmland in Sweden. I'm both norwegian ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ and swedish ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª, and quite fitting I work in Oslo.

I mostly program modern web applications these days. Heavy JavaScript kind of stuffs. I also do some golang occationally and have previously done a few thingies in Java, for example [plugins for Minecraft/Bukkit](https://minecraft.jeremy.se/).

Nature, music, history (mostly scandinavian), genealogy and etnobotanics are fields I find very interesting.

As I am norwegian I also got a domain for that country. [jeremy.no](https://jeremy.no/)
