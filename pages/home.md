I'm a web developer from VÃ¤rmland in Sweden. I'm both norwegian ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ and swedish ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª. I work for the norwegian based music streming company [TIDAL](https://tidal.com) and also run businesses on the side. Namely [Glatek](https://glatek.se) for IT and [Barlingshult SmÃ¥bruk](https://barlingshult.se) for farming.

I mostly program modern web applications. Heavy JavaScript kind of stuffs. Some examples are [nightcore.app](https://nightcore.app), [podd.app](https://podd.app) and [plypp.net](https://plypp.net).

Nature, music, history (mostly scandinavian), genealogy and ethnobotanics are fields I find very interesting.
